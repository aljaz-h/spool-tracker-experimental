"""Universal Import Review pipeline.

The core rule this module exists to enforce: an initial/full import from
any source (Trakt/Simkl/Nuvio/CSV/JSON/ZIP) never writes anything into
canonical Spool state (Title/Episode/WatchEvent/WatchProgress/
WatchListItem/ratings) until the user has reviewed what would be
imported and explicitly confirmed it. Routine scheduled sync (the
existing per-provider tasks in tasks.py) is untouched by this module and
stays automatic.

Two phases, kept strictly separate:

- **scan** - read-only. Fetches/parses the source's raw data (file
  parsing lives here via scan_file_import; a provider's own network
  fetch - with credentials/token-refresh - stays owned by tasks.py,
  which then calls the source-agnostic scan_normalized_items with its
  own normalize_<source>_item()-shaped list), resolves title matches via
  tracker.title_matching.resolve_title_match (never apply_title_match -
  scan must not write), detects duplicates against existing WatchEvents,
  and bulk-creates ImportCandidate rows describing what commit *would*
  do. Never creates a Title/Episode/WatchEvent, never touches a rating/
  progress/watchlist, never triggers recommendation/completion/rewatch
  recalculation.
- **commit** (`commit_session`) - processes only status=PENDING,
  selected=True candidates, reusing tracker.title_matching.
  apply_title_match (the same matching rules scan used, so a candidate
  shown as "new" during review is guaranteed to actually create a new
  Title, never silently merge into one that scan didn't know about).
  Flips each candidate's own status as it's processed - the idempotency
  mechanism a retried/resumed commit relies on (see commit_session's own
  docstring). One implementation, shared by every source, since every
  source's candidates end up as the same ImportCandidate shape.

Wired for CSV/JSON/ZIP file imports (via tracker.csv_import's existing
parsers) and Trakt (via tracker.integrations.trakt.fetch_history +
normalize_history_item) - Simkl/Nuvio scan adapters land in a later
stage, reusing scan_normalized_items/commit_session rather than a
parallel implementation. tasks.scan_import_session is the single place
that dispatches a scan by session.source.
